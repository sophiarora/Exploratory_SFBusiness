# Exploratory_SFBusiness
In this analysis I analysed data from [DataSF](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Registered-Business-Locations-San-Francisco/g8m3-pdis). The Dataset contains registered business opening, ending times, location, neighbor hood and related information for all businesses that pay/paid taxes to City and County of San Francisco.

The dataset is updated weekly on the website. The dataset for this analysis was collected on 09-30-2016. So we are mainly concerned with business activate around that time.

In the following analysis, I cleaned the dataset to eliminate abnormal data points. I then identify active high-growth regions using `ggmap`. I also analyze the start dates and find interesting insights about industry trend.
